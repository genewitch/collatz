# collatz
collatz conjecture simple C# code

Requires emil.GMP and libgmp.

You can pass a number on the command line (like from http://boinc.thesonntags.com/collatz/highest_steps.php)
or you can touch a file called lastnumber.txt and put a number in there.

output: step leaders go to mostcount.txt, last solved number is in lastnumber.txt, console displays some info every time the files are flushed.
